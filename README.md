# Pipex Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Pipex** project repository! This project was an exciting opportunity to dive into UNIX system programming.
By creating a program that mimics the behavior of shell pipes, I gained hands-on experience with process management, inter-process communication, and error handling in C.

## Project Description

The **Pipex** program replicates the behavior of piping commands in a UNIX shell. It reads input from a file,
processes it through a series of commands, and writes the final output to another file. This program is designed to work with two commands and follows UNIX conventions closely.

### Usage

To use the program, run the following command:

```bash
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
